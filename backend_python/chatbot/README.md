# Generate summary of any video

This app makes it easy to generate automated responses to a user’s input. This app uses a selection of machine learning algorithms to produce different types of responses.

The language independent design of this app allows it to be trained to speak any language. Additionally, the machine-learning nature of this app allows an agent instance to improve it’s own knowledge of possible responses as it interacts with humans and other sources of informative data.

An untrained instance of this app starts off with no knowledge of how to communicate. Each time a user enters a statement, the app saves the text that they entered and the text that the statement was in response to. As this app receives more input the number of responses that it can reply and the accuracy of each response in relation to the input statement increase.

The program selects the closest matching response by searching for the closest matching known statement that matches the input, it then chooses a response from the selection of known responses to that statement.
